# react-native-jw-media-player

### A react-native bridge for JWPlayer native SDK's

<img width="200" alt="sample" src="./images/1.png">

## Getting started

`npm i react-native-jw-media-player --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

Since **React Native 0.60** and higher, [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) makes the installation process simpler.

On iOS you have to run `cd ios/` && `pod install`.

On Android the package is automatically linked.

### Using React Native Link (React Native 0.59 and lower)

Link module with

`$ react-native link react-native-jw-media-player`

Then add SDK dependencies:

#### Add dependencies

##### iOS dependencies

Follow official instructions [iOS sdk installation](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/ios-getting-started) for installation via Cocoapods (only supported, other way wasn't tested).

Add `pod 'JWPlayer-SDK', '~> 3.16.0'` to your Podfile.
Then run **pod install** from your `ios` directory.

In your `info.plist` properties file, create a string entry named `JWPlayerKey`, and set its value to be your JW Player Beta license key. Make sure you enter this string exactly as you received it from JW Player, or as it appears in your JW Player Dashboard. The string is case-sensitive.

##### Android dependencies

Follow official instructions [Android sdk installation](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/android-getting-started)

Insert the following lines inside the allProjects.dependencies block in `android/build.gradle`:

```
maven{
    url 'https://mvn.jwplayer.com/content/repositories/releases/'
}
```
As so
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        maven {
            // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
            url("$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android")
        }
        maven {
            // Android JSC is installed from npm
            url("$rootDir/../node_modules/jsc-android/dist")
        }

        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        // Add these lines
        maven{
            url 'https://mvn.jwplayer.com/content/repositories/releases/'
        }
    }
}
```

Add to AndroidManifest.xml in the Application tag above the Activity tag:

```
<meta-data
    android:name="JW_LICENSE_KEY"
    android:value="<API_KEY_FOUND_IN_JW_DASHBOARD>" />
```

... and these lines (This is needed for the controls bar in notification center).

```
<receiver android:name="androidx.media.session.MediaButtonReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
<service
    android:name="com.appgoalz.rnjwplayer.MediaPlaybackService"
    android:exported="false">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```

and this line to the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle` (also needed for the controls bar in notification center).

```
implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.1.0'

```

JW uses some of google services in their sdk so if you get an error about any missing google services (e.g. `ERROR: Failed to resolve: com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:16.0.0`) you can add this line to the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```
api 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:+'
```

### Manual installation

#### iOS

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-jwplayer` and add `RNJWPlayer.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNJWPlayer.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Add [dependencies](#ios-dependencies)
5. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)<

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`

- Add `import net.gamesofton.rnjwplayer.RNJWPlayerPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
- Add `new RNJWPlayerPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
   ```
    include ':react-native-jwplayer'
    project(':react-native-jwplayer').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-jwplayer/android')
   ```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```
    implementation project(':react-native-jwplayer')
   ```
4. Add [dependencies](#android-dependencies)

## Usage

```javascript
...

import JWPlayer, { JWPlayerState } from 'react-native-jw-media-player';

...

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  player: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

...

const playlistItem = {
  title: 'Track',
  mediaId: -1,
  image: 'http://image.com/image.png',
  desc: 'My beautiful track',
  time: 0,

  // Not Recommended - load the playlistItem into the player with loadPlaylistItem method
  /*
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.JWPlayer.loadPlaylistItem(playlistItem);

    // for playlist
    // const playlist = [playlistItem, playlistItem]
    // this.JWPlayer.loadPlaylist(playlistItem);

##### Custom-style

For setting a custom style on the player:

  1. Check out the [JW player guide](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-player/docs/developer-guide/customization/css-skinning/skins_reference/) for adding a custom css file on your player.

  2. Put your custom css file in the root folder of your native files.

  3. Add the prop `playerStyle` to the player and set to the name of your css file without the .css file type e.g. `playerStyle={'myCssFile'}`.

  4. build & run.

##### Colors

To set the colors of icons and progress bar pass to the player a prop as such.

Note: It is expected to pass the colors in hex format without the hashtag example for white FFFFFF.

```javascript
colors: PropTypes.shape({
  icons: PropTypes.string,
  timeslider: PropTypes.shape({
    progress: PropTypes.string,
    rail: PropTypes.string
  })
})
```

### AudioTrack

Each AudioTrack object has the following keys:

`autoSelect`: boolean

`defaultTrack`: boolean

`groupId`: string

`name`: string

`language`: string

A video file can include multiple audio tracks. The onAudioTracks event is fired when the list of available AudioTracks is updated (happens shortly after a playlist item starts playing).

Once the AudioTracks list is available, use getAudioTracks to return an array of available AudioTracks.

Then use getCurrentAudioTrack or setCurrentAudioTrack(index) to view or change the current AudioTrack.

This is all handled automatically if using the default player controls, but these functions are helpful if you're implementing custom controls.

### Stretching

`uniform`: (default) Fits JW Player dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio

`exactFit`: Will fit JW Player dimensions without maintaining aspect ratio

`fill`: Will zoom and crop video to fill dimensions, maintaining aspect ratio

`none`: Displays the actual size of the video file. (Black borders)

##### Examples:

![Stretching Example](https://files.readme.io/ce19994-stretch-options.png)

(image from JW Player docs - here use `exactFit` instead of `exactfit`)

### Background Audio

This package supports Background audio sessions by setting the `backgroundAudioEnabled` prop on the [PlaylistItem](#PlaylistItem), just follow the JWPlayer docs for background session.

Here for Android https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/android-audiotrack#background-audio although this package handles background audio playing in android as is and you shouldn't have to make any additional changes.

Here for iOS https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs/ios-behavior#background-audio under Background Audio section.

For iOS you will have to enable `audio` in **Signing & Capabilities** under `background modes`.

### Casting

###### iOS

Edit your `Info.plist` with the following values:

```
'NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription' => 'We will use your Bluetooth for media casting.',
'NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription' => 'We will use your Bluetooth for media casting.',
'NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription' => 'We will use the local network to discover Cast-enabled devices on your WiFi network.',
'Privacy - Local Network Usage Description' => 'We will use the local network to discover Cast-enabled devices on your WiFi network.'
'NSMicrophoneUsageDescription' => 'We will use your Microphone for media casting.'
```

Enable *Access WiFi Information* capability under `Signing & Capabilities`
